EyePerture is a command line interface to Apple Aperture, allowing you to
import an arbitrary set of images to Aperture project. Initially this
application was designed to work with Eye-Fi (as Eye-Fi Center does not
support working with Aperture out of the box), however you can use it for
simple image importing.

EyePerture requires appscript (http://appscript.sourceforge.net/) to work.

Import is based on the following structure:
	Library
		[Folder] "Eye-Fi Import"
			[Project] Current date in YYYY-MM-DD format

You can change the generated folder name or project name with -f or -p options
respectively.

Usage: ./eyeperture.py [-f FOLDER] [-p PROJECT] [-c|-m|-r] FILES ...
